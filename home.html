        <h2>A Journey Through My Musical Career</h2>
        <p class="firstp">My musical journey started at the early age of 5 when my parents put in keyboard lessons. Since then, I have grown a passion for music. Throughout my life this has manifested in playing instruments, experimenting with creating music digitally, and listening to a lot of music.

        <p class="homeparagraphs">I started piano at age 5. I first did keyboard lessons at my local recreation center. As I progressed through the levels, I started using an electric piano so I could play with dynamics and using the foot pedals. I started preparing for the Royal Conservatory of Music tests at age 10. However this made practicing feel more like a chore than an enjoyable hobby. That is why I stopped piano lessons at age 12. I was also getting enough musical enjoyment from playing the clarinet in band classes at school.</p>

        <p class="homeparagraphs">Playing in a band was a new type of joy that I could not experience playing the piano. When you play in a band you have to listen to each other & work together to create the music. When practicing as a band, it feels so accomplishing when you start to hear it coming together. I built a community, we had so many inside jokes, and I have met so many amazing people and one of my best friends is someone who I played clarinet with in band. During the first year of attending the University of Waterloo, I spent a lot of time adjusting to this major shift in my life, but in second year I decided to go to the University of Waterloo Concert Band's (UWCBC) social event for the Fall of 2023 term. After this event I felt re-connected to a passion that I did not experience with my peers in GBDA, and it was refreshing. I joined the band and we held an end of term concert at the end of November 2023. My friends were able to attend and support, and it was lovely to show them what we accomplished over our weekly practices.</p>

        <p class="homeparagraphs">Going back to 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdowns, we were not able to have our normal band classes. Since we could not be graded in band, our projects pivoted to showcases were we could choose a project based off of what we had available to us during the lockdown. I used the music production software, FL Studio, to recreate Epiphany by BTS, recording my clarinet to play the vocals, and digitally producing the other instruments. I also used GarageBand to create a mashup of Fake Love and Black Swan by BTS and Bad Boy by Red Velvet.</p>
